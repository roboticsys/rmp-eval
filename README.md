A Linux utility for evaluating PC hardware capability to run the [RMP EtherCAT Motion Controller](https://www.roboticsys.com/rmp-ethercat-motion-controller).

## Purpose

This tool helps determine if your [PC hardware meets the latency requirements](https://support.roboticsys.com/rmp/guide-pc-latency-jitter-bios.html) for running the RMP EtherCAT Motion Controller. RMP requires consistent real-time performance with specific latency thresholds that depend on your sample rate (e.g., 1000Hz requires <125µs latency).

Use this utility during the PC hardware evaluation phase to:

- Test cyclic timing performance of your isolated CPU
- Evaluate network interface card (NIC) performance with hardware timestamps
- Identify timing variability before deploying RMP

## Download

Pre-built packages are available to download for amd64 and arm64 from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/roboticsys/rmp-eval/releases) page.

**Debian/Ubuntu Installation:**

```bash
# Install
sudo dpkg -i rmp-eval_*.deb
```

## Usage

**Important:** This tool must be run as root to access raw sockets and set real-time thread priorities. A PREEMPT_RT kernel is required for RMP.

**Basic cyclic test (no NIC):**

```bash
sudo rmp-eval
```

**NIC test with EtherCAT drive (replace `enp2s0` with your NIC name):**

```bash
sudo rmp-eval --nic enp2s0
```

**Note:** The NIC must have an EtherCAT drive connected for this test.

**Check system configuration only (no timing tests):**

```bash
sudo rmp-eval --only-config
```

This runs all configuration checks and exits without starting timing threads.

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the test and view final results.

## Example Output

```bash
sudo ./rmp-eval --nic enp2s0
